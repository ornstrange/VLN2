All of the skill in the world isn’t going to save you or your spot in first place when some punk decides to fire a Blue shell your way.  Beneath its colorful, cartoonish appearance, there lies a game so brutal it makes Mad Max look like bumper cars.  This successor to Super Mario Kart was able to ditch the Mode 7 graphics for genuine 3D racetracks. With a grand total of 16 increasingly-challenging courses, crisscrossing every corner of the Mushroom Kingdom, and 8 playable Mario veterans behind the wheel, Mario Kart 64 is a title that never runs out of surprises. Whether it’s making hairpin turns on slippery ice sheets, dodging the crushing Thwomps that line the halls of Bowser’s castle, or stealing victory at the last second with a well-timed Mega Mushroom Speed Boost, Mario Kart 64 is loaded with peril at every turn. But even if you managed to master all the dastardly racetracks of the main game, Mario Kart 64’s Battle Mode is guaranteed to leave you with a white-knuckled grip on your controller. Forget about momentum; this game mode is four sadistic speedways designed to let you wreck anything that moves. So if you’re looking for a crash course in why the Nintendo 64 was the greatest multiplayer console ever made, look no further. Get some friends together and get ready to burn some serious rubber in this rip-roaring, road-rage rampage!",

Each level not only presented gamers to a new and colorful world, but also the new capabilities of the system. At it’s core the game is still the same. The evil Bowser has Kidnapped Princess Peach! Again. But, this time he was too lazy to even leave her castle. Now it’s up to everyone’s favorite plumber to step in and send the deadbeat dictator packing! Players move Mario across the level by running and jumping to avoid obstacles and defeat enemies. However, this formula becomes an entirely new experience, when you set it in fully rendered three-dimensional worlds. Worlds where Mario now had to hold his breath to swim underwater, making deep dives dangerous plunges into the unknown. Worlds where Mario flies above and around technicolor clouds! Worlds that had to be explored from literally every angle, by moving a dynamic camera around Mario. Worlds so complex that numerous missions could be set within the same space, making each replay a completely new challenge. In short: Worlds that had never before been possible! Super Mario 64 is guaranteed to bring back all kinds of nostalgia, as you listen to the plucky plumber’s shoes tap along the halls of Princess Peaches castle. It’s an unforgettable experience that will make you fall in love with your N64 all over again, and again, and again.",

The idea of a game that would allow you to live out scenarios from over three decades of action-packed movies was sheer brilliance, and doubtlessly would have made GoldenEye a great game in its own right. But then at the last minute, one of the developers had the idea to throw in a multiplayer mode, and a gaming legend was born. With over 40 playable characters, 32 devastating weapons, 11 treacherous death maps, 8 separate game modes, a metric ton of game-shattering cheat options, all at the disposal of up to 4 players at once made GoldenEye the greatest multiplayer game of its generation. The idea of four friends all clumped together on a couch, and staring at the same screen is a lost novelty these days. And that’s a shame. Games like GoldenEye really brought out a sense of comradery. It takes good humor, and some serious guts to laugh at the guy you just drove over with a digital tank, when they’re sitting two feet away from you. And focusing on just your quarter of the television screen, never knowing when your enemies would spring out to attack you was an experience that never let the tension ease up for a second...unless you were a dirty cheater who decided to look at where everyone else was standing and throw grenades at them like you were some sort of psychic demolitions expert. Either way, GoldenEye was endless fun to play and remains a title that will leave you shaken and stirred.",

      "desc" : "Super Smash Bros is one of those rare games you never knew you’d always wanted. I mean, how many of us were really hoping that there was a game where that racecar driver from F-Zero could repeatedly punch the kid from Earthbound. But then somehow, out of nowhere, that game popped into existence. And it was the greatest thing ever. Super Smash Bros was a revolutionary game for two reasons. Firstly, it was Nintendo’s long overdue crossover game that brought together characters from its many franchises for one epic quest. It’s just that I think most of us thought that it would be something other than beating each other senseless. And secondly: Smash redefined what a fighting game could be. It took the two-dimensional combat of Street Fighter, but placed it in a variety of colorful stages that players could jump around like a traditional platformer. Then it took the usual one on one battle mechanics and tossed them out the window. Want Mario to use his special fireball move? Just press the “B” button. You want Mario to do a special uppercut move that makes his opponents explode into golden coins? Yeah, that’s a trickier one; press “Up and B.” There were no fancy inputs for super moves, up to four people could play at the same time, and they gave you items to use against opponents. And, what items they were! Pokeballs, Warp Stars, Invincibility Stars, explosive Bob-ombs, proximity mines, ray guns, Super Hammers and more! And the fighting arenas were all plucked from the greatest video game levels across the Nintendo universe. Get your buddies together, choose an adorable cartoon mascot, and then send them to lava-filled depths of Planet Zebes to fight until only one is left standing. Not extreme enough? How about the vacuum of space, on top of Star Fox’s mothership, while Arwings indiscriminately fire lasers at everyone? Too much? Try out Kirby’s Dreamland. It has a tree that can make the wind blow against you...every time you’re trying to avoid falling down a bottomless pit. Was it fair game? No. Was it balanced? Heck, no! Was it fun? Undeniably. Nintendo’s four-player party/fighting crossover game is something weird and wonderful. If you own a Nintendo 64 and at least one controller, there’s no reason it shouldn’t be in your library.",

So, how did Nintendo go about creating a sequel that could hope to live up to its predecessor’s greatness? Well, they doubled down on everything. Literally. With more than twice as many iconic Mario characters behind the wheel, a garage bursting with 21 over-the- top vehicles, 16 enormous tracks, and more special items than ever, this Mario Kart was completely retooled, revved up, and ready to ride! But the best part was that this time, you didn’t have to ride alone. Mario Kart Double Dash was all about teamwork. One player drove the vehicle, while the other hung off the rear bumper to handle every weapon, trap, and power-up you picked up along the way. Oh, and they could literally punch any Kart that dared get too close to you. Additionally two-player teams could switch roles on the fly, creating the first ever tag-team racing, battle royale in gaming history. But even if you didn’t have a buddy with which to play, the Gamecube’s intuitive controls allowed to you switch up your team with the press of a button. But, what really allows Double Dash to take the lead is the fact it was one of the only Gamecube games specifically designed for competitive play. The Nintendo Gamecube Broadband Adapter enabled actual LAN connectivity between multiple consoles. Or to put it plainly, this was a racing game that could host up to 16 players at the same time! Throw in a ton of multiplayer battle modes, and you’ve got a racing game that left all its competition in the dust. Nintendo GameCube game in good used condition.",

Weighing in at a ludicrous 32 megabytes, sporting state of the art 3D graphics, and an unforgettably atmospheric synth soundtrack, spanning six sprawling worlds, Donkey Kong Country was an absolute beast of a game. Additionally, Donkey Kong got to team up with his new sidekick, Diddy Kong, and a ton of epic animal mounts in one incredible quest to reclaim their stolen banana horde. The full adventure was over 100 levels of nonstop minecart riding, deep sea diving, barrel bursting, KONG collecting, Boss battling, monkey mayhem.

This gave rise to what is lovingly remembered as the Collectathon genre. The goal of these games was to search every lovingly-rendered inch of the world to find all kinds of secrets and treasures. Sort of like a scavenger hunt, with about a million other adventures and mini-games on the side. And it all began with Banjo Kazooie. What makes this game so great is that there’s never one mammoth goal you’ll be tackling. The world isn’t about to be destroyed. There is no princess in peril. You’re just a cartoon Bear, sporting a backpack where his cartoon Bird pal likes to chill. All nine game worlds are brimming with this cartoonish, colorful, personality. And it just makes wandering through them an absolute delight. As you explore, you’ll be presented with a smorgasbord of fun, little tasks to choose as you please. Collect a golden puzzle piece, listen to some musical fanfare. Then move on to the next thing on the itinerary. Congratulations. You just spent five hours playing this game and didn’t even notice. Banjo Kazooie is notorious for just how easily it sucks you in. And that’s because every bit of it is just plain, honest fun. And really, isn’t that what every game ought to be? It’s a 64-bit classic that hasn’t aged a day. Play it, replay it, and fall in love with its irresistible charms all over again.",

In order to set things straight, the plucky plumber dons the all new FLUDD device that allows him to run faster, jump higher, float across deadly pits, and clean even the toughest stains with it’s powerful water cannons. Mario’s Dinosaur friend Yoshi also helps out, making its first main series appearance since Super Mario World for the SNES.

This Mario title is occasionally overshadowed by other games in the series, but make no mistake, this game definitely shines through where it counts. Isle Delfino is a brilliantly colorful world that grows steadily more vibrant as Mario cleans away the gunk in every level. The music is absolutely sublime, and is universally recognized as some of the best composed for the system. And the gameplay, well, it’s Mario!

Even though it was one of the earlier games to come out for the N64, Wave Race still manages to stand out as one of the best looking titles on the system. All four of the unique jet skis and racers are colorful and beautifully animated. The courses are diverse and filled with realistic hazards, set pieces, and incredible lighting effects. This may be the first N64 game to feature fully rendered lens flares. However, the star of the show is undoubtedly the water. You think that’s a joke? Even today, developers have trouble making water look real. In wave Race 64 it not only looks real, it feels real! Each wave is unique and presents its own swell and crash for players to navigate. During sunny afternoons, the calm ocean is a crystaline blue that allows you to see pods of dolphins frolicking beneath the surface. Those same digital waters visibly darken and turn choppy in stormier weather. As evening approaches, the entire sea takes on a gorgeous sun-kissed hue. That level of detail was completely unprecedented in 1996, and still looks amazing over two decades later. But as fun as it is to stare at imaginary water, a racing game is still only as good as its gameplay. And wow, does Wave Racer 64 deliver! This is a title made for the N64. The whole game is built around the controller’s analog joystick, which rolls effortlessly along the crest of every wave. Crashing into obstacles flings you off your jet ski. Crashing into other racers knocks them off their jet ski. Making sharp turns at full speed is exhilarating, as you try to push your momentum as far as it will go without capsizing yourself. And, the ability to alter your jet ski ‘s attributes to match your play style created endless customization possibilities. In addition to the core arcade mode, Wave Race 64 includes time trials and a stunt mode. The game also sports the obligatory two-player mode that lets you race against friends. There’s a purity to Wave Race 64’s design. It’s a game that never loses sight of its purpose, and that’s straight-up wave racing action. By working to perfect that as much as possible, it makes for an incredible game that leaves everything else its wake.",

Unlike most games in the series, Wind Waker is a direct sequel to Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time for the Nintendo 64. Set hundreds of years after the Hero of Time defeated Ganondorf, players quickly learn that a lot has changed in the land of Hyrule since then. Most noticeably, a sprawling ocean has flooded the entire realm. The rest is up to the player to discover as they take to the seas as a new hero, sporting that unmistakable green tunic and hat. This saga upon the high seas is the first Zelda game to utilize incredible cel-shading techology, giving the entire adventure a sleek, colorful appearance that will make you feel like you are watching an action packed cartoon. This presentation also allows for a color palette that earlier Zelda titles could only dream of. As you sail the Hylian ocean, it’s peaceful cyan waves slowly darken to a sickening greenish hue as storms begin to brew in real time. This digital epic is a visual feast for the eyes throughout every side-quest, dungeon, and boss fight. So cast off into the greatest Zelda adventure of its generation.

Tecmo put you in full control of a roster of real life NFL legends, calling and running their every play. Or you could sit back and just coach from the sidelines, as you constantly mixed up your playbooks, subbed out players, and meticulously tracked your entire locker room’s stats from game to game. And since there were no penalties in Tecmo, you were encouraged to literally destroy the competition. Injuries were even rewarded with brutal cutscenes that really made the game come to life. With its deep mechanics, and ability to take direct control of a player’s every action on the field, Tecmo paved the way for what would become the standard for pretty much every other sports game that followed. It was the first fully immersive pro sports game, and has frequently been listed as one of the top 10 most influential games of all time since its release in ‘91. Tecmo has endured and become a timeless game that continues to attract new players each year. Today, there are over 26 National Leagues of dedicated Tecmo players in North America alone. All of them, still playing for the love of the game. So, if you’re thinking of picking up this All-American classic, don’t even bother wondering if it’s any good. It is. All you need to ask is “ARE YOU READY FOR SOME FOOTBALL?”",

Seriously, you could just stand on top of most monsters and they wouldn’t even notice you were there. Of all things you were expected to defeat your enemies with vegetables. Yup. You yanked ‘em out of the ground, then lobbed ‘em around like rocks. And who ever said turnips were good for you? Additionally, this was the game that really expanded the Mario cast. For the first time ever you could play as Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, and Toad, all with their own unique abilities to help them navigate the dream world, discover the secrets of the subspace doors, and end the reign of King Wart. But what really makes this one unique is the fact that even after decades of new Mario games and spinoffs, there has never been a title to imitate the gameplay of the original sequel.

But, there was a simpler time when all he did was jump around and save the princess. It wasn’t until the groundbreaking game, Super Mario Kart, that Mario decided to take something new for a test drive. Much like F-Zero before it, Mario Kart was a racing game that utilized the Super Nintendo’s revolutionary Mode 7 graphics to make you really make you feel like you were behind the wheel. However, unlike F-Zero, Mario Kart was designed to be a multiplayer experience. The entire game is presented in two-player friendly split-screen. Even when your playing solo modes, the lower half of the screen is devoted to showing off where every one of your opponents were located on the track, which is pretty useful to know when any one of them could try and snipe you with a green shell from behind. Oh. Yeah, this was one of the first ever Racing Games to give players a small arsenal of weapons, power-ups, and traps to make sure you were always on your toes. This was such an integral part of the game, it even got a special “Battle” mode, where the only way to win was to destroy the competition. However you chose to play, there was no arguing that when it came to gaming with family and friends, Mario Kart was the Super Nintendo’s gold standard.",

When Super Mario Bros starts up, you’re greeted with a gorgeous title screen and total silence. Then you press start, and it all springs to life! The music pipes up, the characters start moving, and soon you’re reveling in the chime of every collected coin, the plink of each fireball Mario shoots, and the satisfying sight of every Goomba smushed and Koopa Shell kicked. I bet that if you close your eyes, you can still remember every little detail. Even the secret warp pipes and magic bean stalks that lead to incredible rewards. Maybe the fanfare that roared whenever you defeated the dread King Bowser in one of his evil castles. Super Mario Bros. isn’t a game that needs description. It sticks with you, no matter how long it’s been since you last held a game pad. It’s an experience like no other, and, it’s waiting for you discover it all over again.",

Unfortunately, its release was delayed a bit when Nintendo demanded the ability to run over cows be removed from rural levels. Regardless of how you may feel about this decision, the end result was a rock-solid port of the racing game sensation that had been burning up arcades for over two years. Now, in all honesty, being one of the first games for Nintendo’s flagship 3D system means that Cruis’n USA is missing some of the polish of later releases. But, presentation was never what Cruis’n USA was all about. And it certainly isn’t what made it a classic. No. This is a game about two things: racing and speed. And dang, if it doesn’t deliver on both! There’s an almost Zen-like beauty in its simplicity. Slam on the ignition, scream towards the finish line, and repeat. No gimmicks. No sneaky Blue Shells. Just pure racing action. So the next time you just want to unwind, tune out, and burn some serious rubber, Cruis’n USA is still revved up and waiting for you to take it for another spin.",

But when he doesn’t come back, it’s up to his nervous twin brother to investigate the creepy manor. Wouldn’t you know it, the entire mansion is haunted with hundreds of vengeful ghosts! And just to add injury to insult, they’ve trapped Mario in a cursed painting, where he shall remain forever trapped if Luigi can’t set him free by dawn. It’s kind of messed up, so Luigi turns to a local eccentric inventor for help. This questionable genius gives Luigi a high-tech flashlight and vacuum cleaner to stun and suck up the goofy ghosts, as he clears a path to save his brother. Please remember, this was one of the select few 2001 launch-titles designed to showcase the power of the Nintendo Gamecube. Nintendo was confident in this game, and with good reason. Every room of the “Luigi’s Mansion” is absolutely brimming with secrets, both the collectible kind, and the technical ones. Advanced dynamic lighting created stretching shadows, while cutting edge particle physics caused clouds of dust to explode wherever Luigi’s feet fell, and newly created rendering techniques enabled a host of ghosts that appeared in varying degrees of transparency. Luigi’s Mansion is more than a game, it’s one of the most elaborate technical demos ever created! But what do you care about cutting edge graphics from 2001? Good question. Luigi’s Mansion is still a game first, and a showcase second. So, spotting a spectre’s shadow or disturbances in the dust are critical to spotting the invisible specters before they get the jump on Luigi. The experience is continually suspenseful, without ever becoming truly scary. It’s a horror game that’s meant to surprise the player rather than shock or scare them. This makes Luigi’s Mansion uniquely fun for all ages, and makes it a game whose compelling tone is without peer. So, grab your Haunted Hoover, and start cleaning up some creepy crawlies. Luigi’s Mansion is still a title that cleans house when compared to most games on the system. Nintendo GameCube game in good used condition.",

Conker was Rare’s swan song, a compilation of everything they’d learned from making a half decade worth of masterpieces. Conker combined the shooting mechanics of Goldeneye, the third person action of Jet Force Gemini, and the colorful platforming gameplay of Banjo-Kazooie, to create something wonderfully twisted. Just beneath it’s cutesy appearance, Conker was a depraved game. It starred a binge- drinking squirrel, who urinated on enemies, messily blasted heads to bits with with a shotgun, and battled enormous, opera singing, mounds of poo. This sort of madness made Conker one of the most deranged, rude, and downright hilarious games ever made. Filled with over 2 hours of profanity-filled audio, some of most gorgeous graphics ever featured on the N64, support for full Dolby Surround sound, a robust set of multiplayer games, and more hilarious movie references than you can count, Conker packed its entire 64-bit cartridge with awesome content.",

So, how did the mad geniuses at Rareware try to top Donkey Kong’s first near-perfect 16-bit adventure? Well for starters, they actually cut Donkey Kong from his own sequel! In what remains one of the boldest moves in gaming history, they ditched the series’ lead and replaced him with his sidekick: Diddy Kong, as well as Diddy’s girlfriend, Dixie. And against all logic. the result was incredible. Donkey Kong Country 2 was faster, featured refined graphics, revolutionary weather effects, and blasted out full stereo sound in the biggest Donkey Kong game yet. In their quest to free the kidnapped Donkey Kong from a crew of cutthroat Kremlings, Diddy and Dixie infiltrated the pirate base in the heart of the dreaded Crocodile Isle. Eight worlds of treacherous traps, relentless enemies, and more secrets than ever made Kong Quest one of the toughest, most satisfying SNES experiences ever made.",

Additionally, every single Pokemon got a graphic overhaul to appear more like they did in the hit cartoon show and official game artwork. In fact, Yellow Version does a lot to feel more like the cartoon. Pikachu was now your default starting Pokemon, and rather than sit in a Pokeball, it literally walks beside you for the entire game. Even the series’ Team Rocket antagonists, Jessie and James, make cameos. New trainers and fresh challenges awaited anyone who was brave enough to explore this freshly remixed world of Pokemon. Added goodies like the secret Surfing Pikachu mini-game did a lot to distinguish this series entry from its predecessors, and offer what is hands down the best way to experience the original Pokemon epic.",

Link’s inventory of epic weapons was twice as big. With the addition of the perilous Dark World, the game map was now three times bigger. And with every fresh puzzle, trap, and enemy, it proved to be four times tougher than ever. This was the game that pushed you to explore every corner of its seemingly endless fields, dungeons, and forests to discover every last one of its secrets. With an unforgettable soundtrack that would go on to be remastered time and time again, a sweeping narrative, and advanced battling controls, A Link to the Past was the game that rightfully set the standard for all Zelda games to follow.

But, how do you recreate the intense focus on exploration, hidden secrets, and fearsome Science Fiction fire fights that always defined the Metroid series in a three dimensional world? That’s not an easy question to answer. In fact, it took eight years for the developers at Nintendo to create a game that could bring all the thrills of Super Metroid from the SNES to a new generation of gamers as well as gaming hardware. But, Metroid Prime proved to be more than worth the wait. Prime brought a different viewpoint to the game’s core design. Literally. For the first time ever, players saw the world through the eyes of Intergalactic Bounty Hunter, and occasional savior of the Universe, Samus Aran. However, Metroid Prime was far more than your typical first-person shooter. New weapons, gear, and keys were necessary to venture deeper into the Space Pirate’s stronghold, and finding them was crucial to progression. Additionally, Samus could still roll into her Morphball form to enter all manner of nooks, crannies, and air ducts to discover even more hidden goodies. This focus on exploration, coupled with state-of-the-art first-person gun fights made for an experience like no other. Metroid Prime wasn’t just a game that brought new life the adventures of Samus, it was a title that proved there was plenty of solid gameplay ideas to be found by revisiting what made older titles great. Today, Metroid Prime is largely recognized as one of the greatest games ever made, for its innovation, peerless design, and relentless pacing. Whether its your first time storming the alien fortresses of Tallon IV or you’re returning for another tour of duty, Metroid Prime is one game that never ceases to impress.",

The new profile perspective gave Link a new way to engage enemies in deadly combat.

Or you could use Link’s new magical spells to transform into an unstoppable juggernaut, capable of leveling armies with barrages of fireballs and lightning bolts. Adventure of Link let you experiment with how you approached every new challenge. And thanks to Nintendo’s exclusive “Extended Playing Power,” the game was programmed to remember your entire loadout before each battle, so no matter how many times you fell in combat, you could always come back and try again with your full arsenal at the ready.

Always, ratcheting up the difficulty a little bit each time. Can you handle the responsibility of maintaining your own paper route? Cute. Let’s see how well you handle under pressure. Because make no mistake, Paperboy is a test of your very mettle. How frequently will you make your stops when every vehicle on the road is out to mow you down? Hmmm? Still alive? Great. Let’s move on to the advanced stuff. Can you still get the news out while you dodge dive-bombing break-dancers, thwart home invasions, escape rabid dogs, and swerve around the ever-increasing number of tombstones that continue to conspicuously fill every yard on the block? What about death? Not the existential threat of it, either. No, we’re talking the actual Grim Reaper! How well will you be able to avoid throwing newspapers into the wrong yards, when the icy breath of the Angel of Death is constantly coursing down your neck? You’re still alive?!! Fine. It’s a shame about all these freak tornadoes that keep hitting your block, isn’t it Paperboy? Oh, and just so you know there’s no pressure, your route always ends in some sort of off-road skate park/paperboy biathalon that is being watched by a literal stadium of cheering spectators. The game just keeps piling on ever more insane obstacles against you and your paper route, like some vindictive god! And, daggumit if that doesn’t make it feel great when you beat it! Paperboy’s gorgeous graphics, and deceptively simple, arcade-perfect gameplay make it yet another fantastic arcade classic for the NES.",

With 8 enormous, interconnected realms to explore, widescreen support, dynamic Dolby surround sound, and rumble pak compatibility the world of Banjo Tooie came to life like no other game before it. It’s hard to overstate just how massive Banjo Tooie really is. So let’s just say that the game’s 9 transformations and ability to play independently as Banjo, Kazooie, or the magical Mumbo were all vital to exploring every inch of this Rare masterpiece. The amount of content packed into this game is staggering: Tooie had more bosses than ever before. It contained a ludicrous number of collectibles, including 90 jiggies. There were over a dozen addictive minigames, and a complete family-friendly first person shooter mode where you used Kazooie to shoot eggs at your opponents. Banjo Tooie is a technical marvel that easily lives up to its predecessor’s reputation, and may well be the most fun ever crammed into a single N64 cartridge.",

This is where Pokemon began. Back before the smart phone app, before there were over two decades of sequel games, mountains of merchandise, a massively popular card game, and dozens of feature films, Pokemon was just a Nintendo Game Boy title. Pokemon Blue Version took the best elements of Japanese RPG games, but added a few revolutionary ideas that would redefine the genre. Rather than just fighting monsters, it let you catch them, train them, and most importantly, trade them with other players. Pokemon was a game that literally brought people together. Pokemon Blue Version was launched alongside Pokemon Red Version, and both titles had exclusive critters. So, the only way anyone could catch all 151 original Pokemon was through teamwork. Blue Version featured the incredible Magmar, Pinsir, Vulpix, and Victreebel, along with seven other unique Pokemon that were nowhere to be found in the Red Version. But, more importantly, it contained an adventure that shaped a generation. In the game, you’re a bright-eyed youth, looking to become the greatest Pokemon Trainer in the world. However, eight gym leaders, the elite four, an organized crime syndicate, and your lifelong rival will all need to be defeated before you can claim that prestigious title. It’s a story that was shared by millions, but experienced differently by every player. No two people had exactly the same team of Pokemon or went about training them in exactly the same way. That was all you. And it can be again. Pokemon is always waiting to be revisited by those who want to be the very best, like no one ever was, both young and old alike.",

With 18 playable characters, 6 massive courses, and a host of different game modes, Mario Golf provided a quality sports game like no other. While not as fast paced as other Mario Sports Games for the Nintendo 64, this made it a pleasantly relaxing diversion that was accessible to new gamers, but contained enough challenge to keep even the most hardcore players investedd in landing that perfect shot. Unlike most games of the time, it even took full advantage of the Nintendo 64 Transfer Pak, so that you could import your Gameboy Golfers from Mario Golf for the Gameboy Color, and let them tackle an entirely new set of greens. Mario Golf took advantage of everything the Nintendo 64 had to offer, and the end result is a game that just draws you in. Maybe it’s the chill music, the fun of watching instant replays of your ball flying across the screen, or just the novelty of Mario and Bowser setting aside their differences to to knock back 18 holes, but there’s no denying that this amazing game is just plain fun.",
