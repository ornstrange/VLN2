All of the skill in the world isn\u2019t going to save you or your spot in first place when some punk decides to fire a Blue shell your way.\u00a0 Beneath its colorful, cartoonish appearance, there lies a game so brutal it makes Mad Max look like bumper cars.\u00a0 This successor to Super Mario Kart was able to ditch the Mode 7 graphics for genuine 3D racetracks. With a grand total of 16 increasingly-challenging courses, crisscrossing every corner of the Mushroom Kingdom, and 8 playable Mario veterans behind the wheel, Mario Kart 64 is a title that never runs out of surprises. Whether it\u2019s making hairpin turns on slippery ice sheets, dodging the crushing Thwomps that line the halls of Bowser\u2019s castle, or stealing victory at the last second with a well-timed Mega Mushroom Speed Boost, Mario Kart 64 is loaded with peril at every turn. But even if you managed to master all the dastardly racetracks of the main game, Mario Kart 64\u2019s Battle Mode is guaranteed to leave you with a white-knuckled grip on your controller. Forget about momentum; this game mode is four sadistic speedways designed to let you wreck anything that moves. So if you\u2019re looking for a crash course in why the Nintendo 64 was the greatest multiplayer console ever made, look no further. Get some friends together and get ready to burn some serious rubber in this rip-roaring, road-rage rampage!",

The evil Bowser has Kidnapped Princess Peach! Again. But, this time he was too lazy to even leave her castle. Now it\u2019s up to everyone\u2019s favorite plumber to step in and send the deadbeat dictator packing! Players move Mario across the level by running and jumping to avoid obstacles and defeat enemies. However, this formula becomes an entirely new experience, when you set it in fully rendered three-dimensional worlds. Worlds where Mario now had to hold his breath to swim underwater, making deep dives dangerous plunges into the unknown. Worlds where Mario flies above and around technicolor clouds! Worlds that had to be explored from literally every angle, by moving a dynamic camera around Mario. Worlds so complex that numerous missions could be set within the same space, making each replay a completely new challenge. In short: Worlds that had never before been possible! Super Mario 64 is guaranteed to bring back all kinds of nostalgia, as you listen to the plucky plumber\u2019s shoes tap along the halls of Princess Peaches castle.

The idea of a game that would allow you to live out scenarios from over three decades of action-packed movies was sheer brilliance, and doubtlessly would have made GoldenEye a great game in its own right. But then at the last minute, one of the developers had the idea to throw in a multiplayer mode, and a gaming legend was born. With over 40 playable characters, 32 devastating weapons, 11 treacherous death maps, 8 separate game modes, a metric ton of game-shattering cheat options, all at the disposal of up to 4 players at once made GoldenEye the greatest multiplayer game of its generation. The idea of four friends all clumped together on a couch, and staring at the same screen is a lost novelty these days. And that\u2019s a shame. Games like GoldenEye really brought out a sense of comradery. It takes good humor, and some serious guts to laugh at the guy you just drove over with a digital tank, when they\u2019re sitting two feet away from you. And focusing on just your quarter of the television screen, never knowing when your enemies would spring out to attack you was an experience that never let the tension ease up for a second...unless you were a dirty cheater who decided to look at where everyone else was standing and throw grenades at them like you were some sort of psychic demolitions expert. Either way, GoldenEye was endless fun to play and remains a title that will leave you shaken and stirred.",

I mean, how many of us were really hoping that there was a game where that racecar driver from F-Zero could repeatedly punch the kid from Earthbound. But then somehow, out of nowhere, that game popped into existence. And it was the greatest thing ever. Super Smash Bros was a revolutionary game for two reasons. Firstly, it was Nintendo\u2019s long overdue crossover game that brought together characters from its many franchises for one epic quest. It\u2019s just that I think most of us thought that it would be something other than beating each other senseless. And secondly: Smash redefined what a fighting game could be. It took the two-dimensional combat of Street Fighter, but placed it in a variety of colorful stages that players could jump around like a traditional platformer. Then it took the usual one on one battle mechanics and tossed them out the window. Want Mario to use his special fireball move? Just press the \u201cB\u201d button. You want Mario to do a special uppercut move that makes his opponents explode into golden coins? Yeah, that\u2019s a trickier one; press \u201cUp and B.\u201d There were no fancy inputs for super moves, up to four people could play at the same time, and they gave you items to use against opponents. And, what items they were! Pokeballs, Warp Stars, Invincibility Stars, explosive Bob-ombs, proximity mines, ray guns, Super Hammers and more! And the fighting arenas were all plucked from the greatest video game levels across the Nintendo universe. Get your buddies together, choose an adorable cartoon mascot, and then send them to lava-filled depths of Planet Zebes to fight until only one is left standing. Not extreme enough? How about the vacuum of space, on top of Star Fox\u2019s mothership, while Arwings indiscriminately fire lasers at everyone? Too much? Try out Kirby\u2019s Dreamland. It has a tree that can make the wind blow against you...every time you\u2019re trying to avoid falling down a bottomless pit. Was it fair game? No. Was it balanced? Heck, no! Was it fun? Undeniably. Nintendo\u2019s four-player party/fighting crossover game is something weird and wonderful. If you own a Nintendo 64 and at least one controller, there\u2019s no reason it shouldn\u2019t be in your library.",

Even though it was one of the earlier games to come out for the N64, Wave Race still manages to stand out as one of the best looking titles on the system. All four of the unique jet skis and racers are colorful and beautifully animated. The courses are diverse and filled with realistic hazards, set pieces, and incredible lighting effects. This may be the first N64 game to feature fully rendered lens flares. However, the star of the show is undoubtedly the water. You think that\u2019s a joke? Even today, developers have trouble making water look real. In wave Race 64 it not only looks real, it feels real! Each wave is unique and presents its own swell and crash for players to navigate. During sunny afternoons, the calm ocean is a crystaline blue that allows you to see pods of dolphins frolicking beneath the surface. Those same digital waters visibly darken and turn choppy in stormier weather. As evening approaches, the entire sea takes on a gorgeous sun-kissed hue. That level of detail was completely unprecedented in 1996, and still looks amazing over two decades later. But as fun as it is to stare at imaginary water, a racing game is still only as good as its gameplay. And wow, does Wave Racer 64 deliver! This is a title made for the N64. The whole game is built around the controller\u2019s analog joystick, which rolls effortlessly along the crest of every wave. Crashing into obstacles flings you off your jet ski. Crashing into other racers knocks them off their jet ski. Making sharp turns at full speed is exhilarating, as you try to push your momentum as far as it will go without capsizing yourself. And, the ability to alter your jet ski \u2018s attributes to match your play style created endless customization possibilities. In addition to the core arcade mode, Wave Race 64 includes time trials and a stunt mode. The game also sports the obligatory two-player mode that lets you race against friends. There\u2019s a purity to Wave Race 64\u2019s design. It\u2019s a game that never loses sight of its purpose, and that\u2019s straight-up wave racing action.

Regardless of how you may feel about this decision, the end result was a rock-solid port of the racing game sensation that had been burning up arcades for over two years. Now, in all honesty, being one of the first games for Nintendo\u2019s flagship 3D system means that Cruis\u2019n USA is missing some of the polish of later releases. But, presentation was never what Cruis\u2019n USA was all about. And it certainly isn\u2019t what made it a classic. No. This is a game about two things: racing and speed. And dang, if it doesn\u2019t deliver on both! There\u2019s an almost Zen-like beauty in its simplicity. Slam on the ignition, scream towards the finish line, and repeat. No gimmicks. No sneaky Blue Shells. Just pure racing action.

But when he doesn\u2019t come back, it\u2019s up to his nervous twin brother to investigate the creepy manor. Wouldn\u2019t you know it, the entire mansion is haunted with hundreds of vengeful ghosts! And just to add injury to insult, they\u2019ve trapped Mario in a cursed painting, where he shall remain forever trapped if Luigi can\u2019t set him free by dawn. It\u2019s kind of messed up, so Luigi turns to a local eccentric inventor for help. This questionable genius gives Luigi a high-tech flashlight and vacuum cleaner to stun and suck up the goofy ghosts, as he clears a path to save his brother. Please remember, this was one of the select few 2001 launch-titles designed to showcase the power of the Nintendo Gamecube. Nintendo was confident in this game, and with good reason. Every room of the \u201cLuigi\u2019s Mansion\u201d is absolutely brimming with secrets, both the collectible kind, and the technical ones. Advanced dynamic lighting created stretching shadows, while cutting edge particle physics caused clouds of dust to explode wherever Luigi\u2019s feet fell, and newly created rendering techniques enabled a host of ghosts that appeared in varying degrees of transparency. Luigi\u2019s Mansion is more than a game, it\u2019s one of the most elaborate technical demos ever created! But what do you care about cutting edge graphics from 2001? Good question. Luigi\u2019s Mansion is still a game first, and a showcase second. So, spotting a spectre\u2019s shadow or disturbances in the dust are critical to spotting the invisible specters before they get the jump on Luigi. The experience is continually suspenseful, without ever becoming truly scary. It\u2019s a horror game that\u2019s meant to surprise the player rather than shock or scare them. This makes Luigi\u2019s Mansion uniquely fun for all ages, and makes it a game whose compelling tone is without peer. So, grab your Haunted Hoover, and start cleaning up some creepy crawlies. Luigi\u2019s Mansion is still a title that cleans house when compared to most games on the system. Nintendo GameCube game in good used condition.",

But, how do you recreate the intense focus on exploration, hidden secrets, and fearsome Science Fiction fire fights that always defined the Metroid series in a three dimensional world? That\u2019s not an easy question to answer. In fact, it took eight years for the developers at Nintendo to create a game that could bring all the thrills of Super Metroid from the SNES to a new generation of gamers as well as gaming hardware. But, Metroid Prime proved to be more than worth the wait. Prime brought a different viewpoint to the game\u2019s core design. Literally. For the first time ever, players saw the world through the eyes of Intergalactic Bounty Hunter, and occasional savior of the Universe, Samus Aran. However, Metroid Prime was far more than your typical first-person shooter. New weapons, gear, and keys were necessary to venture deeper into the Space Pirate\u2019s stronghold, and finding them was crucial to progression. Additionally, Samus could still roll into her Morphball form to enter all manner of nooks, crannies, and air ducts to discover even more hidden goodies. This focus on exploration, coupled with state-of-the-art first-person gun fights made for an experience like no other. Metroid Prime wasn\u2019t just a game that brought new life the adventures of Samus, it was a title that proved there was plenty of solid gameplay ideas to be found by revisiting what made older titles great. Today, Metroid Prime is largely recognized as one of the greatest games ever made, for its innovation, peerless design, and relentless pacing. Whether its your first time storming the alien fortresses of Tallon IV or you\u2019re returning for another tour of duty, Metroid Prime is one game that never ceases to impress.",

Always, ratcheting up the difficulty a little bit each time. Can you handle the responsibility of maintaining your own paper route? Cute. Let\u2019s see how well you handle under pressure. Because make no mistake, Paperboy is a test of your very mettle. How frequently will you make your stops when every vehicle on the road is out to mow you down? Hmmm? Still alive? Great. Let\u2019s move on to the advanced stuff. Can you still get the news out while you dodge dive-bombing break-dancers, thwart home invasions, escape rabid dogs, and swerve around the ever-increasing number of tombstones that continue to conspicuously fill every yard on the block? What about death? Not the existential threat of it, either. No, we\u2019re talking the actual Grim Reaper! How well will you be able to avoid throwing newspapers into the wrong yards, when the icy breath of the Angel of Death is constantly coursing down your neck? You\u2019re still alive?!! Fine. It\u2019s a shame about all these freak tornadoes that keep hitting your block, isn\u2019t it Paperboy? Oh, and just so you know there\u2019s no pressure, your route always ends in some sort of off-road skate park/paperboy biathalon that is being watched by a literal stadium of cheering spectators. The game just keeps piling on ever more insane obstacles against you and your paper route, like some vindictive god! And, daggumit if that doesn\u2019t make it feel great when you beat it! Paperboy\u2019s gorgeous graphics, and deceptively simple, arcade-perfect gameplay make it yet another fantastic arcade classic for the NES.",

It\u2019s hard to overstate just how massive Banjo Tooie really is. So let\u2019s just say that the game\u2019s 9 transformations and ability to play independently as Banjo, Kazooie, or the magical Mumbo were all vital to exploring every inch of this Rare masterpiece. The amount of content packed into this game is staggering: Tooie had more bosses than ever before. It contained a ludicrous number of collectibles, including 90 jiggies. There were over a dozen addictive minigames, and a complete family-friendly first person shooter mode where you used Kazooie to shoot eggs at your opponents. Banjo Tooie is a technical marvel that easily lives up to its predecessor\u2019s reputation, and may well be the most fun ever crammed into a single N64 cartridge.",

While not as fast paced as other Mario Sports Games for the Nintendo 64, this made it a pleasantly relaxing diversion that was accessible to new gamers, but contained enough challenge to keep even the most hardcore players investedd in landing that perfect shot. Unlike most games of the time, it even took full advantage of the Nintendo 64 Transfer Pak, so that you could import your Gameboy Golfers from Mario Golf for the Gameboy Color, and let them tackle an entirely new set of greens. Mario Golf took advantage of everything the Nintendo 64 had to offer, and the end result is a game that just draws you in. Maybe it\u2019s the chill music, the fun of watching instant replays of your ball flying across the screen, or just the novelty of Mario and Bowser setting aside their differences to to knock back 18 holes, but there\u2019s no denying that this amazing game is just plain fun.",

Even the series\u2019 Team Rocket antagonists, Jessie and James, make cameos. New trainers and fresh challenges awaited anyone who was brave enough to explore this freshly remixed world of Pokemon.
