All of the skill in the world isn’t going to save you or your spot in first place when some punk decides to fire a Blue shell your way.  Beneath its colorful, cartoonish appearance, there lies a game so brutal it makes Mad Max look like bumper cars.  This successor to Super Mario Kart was able to ditch the Mode 7 graphics for genuine 3D racetracks. With a grand total of 16 increasingly-challenging courses, crisscrossing every corner of the Mushroom Kingdom, and 8 playable Mario veterans behind the wheel, Mario Kart 64 is a title that never runs out of surprises. Whether it’s making hairpin turns on slippery ice sheets, dodging the crushing Thwomps that line the halls of Bowser’s castle, or stealing victory at the last second with a well-timed Mega Mushroom Speed Boost, Mario Kart 64 is loaded with peril at every turn. But even if you managed to master all the dastardly racetracks of the main game, Mario Kart 64’s Battle Mode is guaranteed to leave you with a white-knuckled grip on your controller. Forget about momentum; this game mode is four sadistic speedways designed to let you wreck anything that moves. So if you’re looking for a crash course in why the Nintendo 64 was the greatest multiplayer console ever made, look no further. Get some friends together and get ready to burn some serious rubber in this rip-roaring, road-rage rampage!", "Game", 14418, "Used"),

Each level not only presented gamers to a new and colorful world, but also the new capabilities of the system. At it’s core the game is still the same. The evil Bowser has Kidnapped Princess Peach! Again. But, this time he was too lazy to even leave her castle. Now it’s up to everyone’s favorite plumber to step in and send the deadbeat dictator packing! Players move Mario across the level by running and jumping to avoid obstacles and defeat enemies. However, this formula becomes an entirely new experience, when you set it in fully rendered three-dimensional worlds. Worlds where Mario now had to hold his breath to swim underwater, making deep dives dangerous plunges into the unknown. Worlds where Mario flies above and around technicolor clouds! Worlds that had to be explored from literally every angle, by moving a dynamic camera around Mario. Worlds so complex that numerous missions could be set within the same space, making each replay a completely new challenge. In short: Worlds that had never before been possible! Super Mario 64 is guaranteed to bring back all kinds of nostalgia, as you listen to the plucky plumber’s shoes tap along the halls of Princess Peaches castle.

The idea of a game that would allow you to live out scenarios from over three decades of action-packed movies was sheer brilliance, and doubtlessly would have made GoldenEye a great game in its own right. But then at the last minute, one of the developers had the idea to throw in a multiplayer mode, and a gaming legend was born. With over 40 playable characters, 32 devastating weapons, 11 treacherous death maps, 8 separate game modes, a metric ton of game-shattering cheat options, all at the disposal of up to 4 players at once made GoldenEye the greatest multiplayer game of its generation. The idea of four friends all clumped together on a couch, and staring at the same screen is a lost novelty these days. And that’s a shame. Games like GoldenEye really brought out a sense of comradery. It takes good humor, and some serious guts to laugh at the guy you just drove over with a digital tank, when they’re sitting two feet away from you. And focusing on just your quarter of the television screen, never knowing when your enemies would spring out to attack you was an experience that never let the tension ease up for a second...unless you were a dirty cheater who decided to look at where everyone else was standing and throw grenades at them like you were some sort of psychic demolitions expert. Either way, GoldenEye was endless fun to play and remains a title that will leave you shaken and stirred.", "Game", 7723, "Used"),

I mean, how many of us were really hoping that there was a game where that racecar driver from F-Zero could repeatedly punch the kid from Earthbound. But then somehow, out of nowhere, that game popped into existence. And it was the greatest thing ever. Super Smash Bros was a revolutionary game for two reasons. Firstly, it was Nintendo’s long overdue crossover game that brought together characters from its many franchises for one epic quest. It’s just that I think most of us thought that it would be something other than beating each other senseless. And secondly: Smash redefined what a fighting game could be. It took the two-dimensional combat of Street Fighter, but placed it in a variety of colorful stages that players could jump around like a traditional platformer. Then it took the usual one on one battle mechanics and tossed them out the window. Want Mario to use his special fireball move? Just press the “B” button. You want Mario to do a special uppercut move that makes his opponents explode into golden coins? Yeah, that’s a trickier one; press “Up and B.” There were no fancy inputs for super moves, up to four people could play at the same time, and they gave you items to use against opponents. And, what items they were! Pokeballs, Warp Stars, Invincibility Stars, explosive Bob-ombs, proximity mines, ray guns, Super Hammers and more! And the fighting arenas were all plucked from the greatest video game levels across the Nintendo universe. Get your buddies together, choose an adorable cartoon mascot, and then send them to lava-filled depths of Planet Zebes to fight until only one is left standing. Not extreme enough? How about the vacuum of space, on top of Star Fox’s mothership, while Arwings indiscriminately fire lasers at everyone? Too much? Try out Kirby’s Dreamland. It has a tree that can make the wind blow against you...every time you’re trying to avoid falling down a bottomless pit. Was it fair game? No. Was it balanced? Heck, no! Was it fun? Undeniably. Nintendo’s four-player party/fighting crossover game is something weird and wonderful. If you own a Nintendo 64 and at least one controller, there’s no reason it shouldn’t be in your library.", "Game", 7723, "Used"),

Most thought it impossible, but Nintendo absolutely crushed it on the first try. Mario entered the 16-bit generation bigger and better than ever.

Gorgeous grasslands, haunted houses, lava-filled caverns, and deathtrap laden lairs were just a few of the daunting obstacles between you and victory. However this time around, Mario brought backup. This was the debut game for Mario’s Dinosaur friend with an appetite: Yoshi. Team up, eat up, and learn to fly to new heights with Mario’s new cape power-up.

Diddy Kong Racing distinguishes itself as, well, a much more serious racing game. It rewards pure skill, over scoring an invincibility star power-up. Furthermore it allows you to explore its tracks in not one, but three separate vehicles: Cars, Hovercrafts, and Planes. That’s three different ways to experience every aspect of this masterfully crafted game. Each vehicle handles differently, and rewards you with new routes to explore, effectively making Diddy Kong Racing three whole games in one! And, if that wasn’t enough, the game even features a complete story mode, with bosses, tougher racers, and a full cast of colorful supporting characters.

You better believe it! With a boatload of new and old power-ups, Mario could shoot fireballs, swim in his frogsuit, annihilate anything sorry enough to cross his path with Hammers, and best of all, fly. Land, sea, and sky, this was the game that let you take the battle against Bowser to all fronts. But, the path to toppling the monstrous turtle tyrant was far from easy...unless you knew where to look for the secret locations of the warp whistles that just let you teleport right to the game’s finale.

Crashing into other racers knocks them off their jet ski. Making sharp turns at full speed is exhilarating, as you try to push your momentum as far as it will go without capsizing yourself. And, the ability to alter your jet ski ‘s attributes to match your play style created endless customization possibilities.

Link’s inventory of epic weapons was twice as big. With the addition of the perilous Dark World, the game map was now three times bigger. And with every fresh puzzle, trap, and enemy, it proved to be four times tougher than ever. This was the game that pushed you to explore every corner of its seemingly endless fields, dungeons, and forests to discover every last one of its secrets. With an unforgettable soundtrack that would go on to be remastered time and time again, a sweeping narrative, and advanced battling controls, A Link to the Past was the game that rightfully set the standard for all Zelda games to follow. While it may not have been the first game in the series, there is no denying that this SNES classici is where the story of Nintendo’s greatest epic truly began.", "Game", 5766, "Used"),

But, how do you recreate the intense focus on exploration, hidden secrets, and fearsome Science Fiction fire fights that always defined the Metroid series in a three dimensional world? That’s not an easy question to answer. In fact, it took eight years for the developers at Nintendo to create a game that could bring all the thrills of Super Metroid from the SNES to a new generation of gamers as well as gaming hardware. But, Metroid Prime proved to be more than worth the wait. Prime brought a different viewpoint to the game’s core design. Literally. For the first time ever, players saw the world through the eyes of Intergalactic Bounty Hunter, and occasional savior of the Universe, Samus Aran. However, Metroid Prime was far more than your typical first-person shooter. New weapons, gear, and keys were necessary to venture deeper into the Space Pirate’s stronghold, and finding them was crucial to progression. Additionally, Samus could still roll into her Morphball form to enter all manner of nooks, crannies, and air ducts to discover even more hidden goodies. This focus on exploration, coupled with state-of-the-art first-person gun fights made for an experience like no other. Metroid Prime wasn’t just a game that brought new life the adventures of Samus, it was a title that proved there was plenty of solid gameplay ideas to be found by revisiting what made older titles great. Today, Metroid Prime is largely recognized as one of the greatest games ever made, for its innovation, peerless design, and relentless pacing. Whether its your first time storming the alien fortresses of Tallon IV or you’re returning for another tour of duty, Metroid Prime is one game that never ceases to impress.", "Game", 1955, "Used"),

In Majora’s Mask, a mischievous imp is possessed by an ancient evil lurking within an accursed faceplate. Link must now stop the little devil from crashing the moon into the earth, ending all life in Termina. Fortunately, this apocalyptic action will take three days to complete and Link not only has his trusty time-travelling ocarina, but also a host of new abilities granted to him by the magical masks he finds scattered across the land. Transform into a dexterous Deku, a mighty Goron and an aquatic Zora, all while the snarling face of the approaching moon looms ever larger. There has never been a more pulse-pounding Zelda adventure, as you strive to save the world while racing the clock, until you have to reset it again.  | This is the special edition cartridge of Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask, preserved in all of its original Holographic Glory.

Unlike any Zelda game before or since, Link was now starring in a side-scrolling, platforming game of epic proportions. The new profile perspective gave Link a new way to engage enemies in deadly combat. By inputting pixel-perfect button presses, skilled gamers could counter any attack with a series of crouches, lunges, and devastating parries. Or you could use Link’s new magical spells to transform into an unstoppable juggernaut, capable of leveling armies with barrages of fireballs and lightning bolts. Adventure of Link let you experiment with how you approached every new challenge. And thanks to Nintendo’s exclusive “Extended Playing Power,” the game was programmed to remember your entire loadout before each battle, so no matter how many times you fell in combat, you could always come back and try again with your full arsenal at the ready.
